# What-Is-The-Weather-Like

## Description

The What's the Weather Like Dashboard is a web application that displays a five day forecast as well as the current day's weather information for any city. Users can search for a city and get real-time data from the OpenWeather API. The application also stores past search data and allows users to access it easily.

Features
Five-day forecast: Displays the weather forecast for the next five days, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Current weather data: Shows the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index for the searched city.
Past search history: Keeps a record of past searches and allows users to revisit the data with just one click.
User-friendly design: The dashboard is easy to use and navigate, with a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, enter the name of a city in the search bar and press enter or click on the search button. The dashboard will then display the current weather data and the five-day forecast for that city. To access past search data, click on the city you want to revisit on the left hand side of the screen.
